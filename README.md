    How to Use This Code :
    This Python script analyzes a text file (DumpFile.txt) to detect network anomalies, generates a bar chart showing the distribution of anomalies, and creates an HTML page to display the results.

        -Place your log file ( DumpFile.txt) in the same directory 
                 as the script or provide the full path to the file. 

        -Execute the script in your Python environment.
        -By default, the script will:
        
            Read the file DumpFile.txt.
            Detect anomalies based on predefined rules 
                (unusual length, suspicious flags, suspicious IPs).
            Generate a bar chart (graphe_anomalies.png)
            Create an HTML report (anomalies.html).

        -View the Results :
        Open the generated anomalies.html orfile in a web browser to see the rept.
        The bar chart (graphe_anomalies.png) will be embedded in the HTML page.
